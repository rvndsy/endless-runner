### Game level
1. Perpetually moving background
2. Character that can jump up
    - gravity of course
3. Coins or some other object to gather points
4. Enemies to kill the character and trigger *game over*
    - Enemies move in sync with the background
        - ? Make enemies foreground and midground move faster to create parallax effect
- If time
5. Increase difficulty over time
    - Things move faster and spawn more frequently over time
6. Add main menu

### Design
- Mostly monochrome - black and white
- Dark background with a city and maybe few faintly lit fires or lights (desaturated yellow)
- White or brighter grayscale foreground with the game elements.
    - Make enemies darker than the player. They have white eyes
    - Player is white
    - The ground is a color between white and bg color
- No ceiling.
    - Maybe caves at some point though?
